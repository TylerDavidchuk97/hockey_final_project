# hockey_final_project
Final project for Concordia

Project Outline

⦁Gather Hockey statistics of players from the history of the nhl using an api or web scraping (using an api would most likely be my first choice)

⦁Given any player that is searched for I would like to find out the following about them. Given their career so far or even retired players I want to create a model that would give a prediction about what their points per game next season would be, if they were to play would look like. E.g.(Sidney Crosby ppg for the 2022-2023 season), this most likely would be done using an Neural Network using LSTM

⦁After that I would like to take the career of the player and find out given all players that played who their closest compareable is. This would be done using all of their career stats. E.g.(Sidney Crosby's goal totals, assist totals, game winning goals, points per game, plus minus, penalty minutes. Who would be his closest compareable player maybe Steve Yzerman for example)

⦁This project would take user input and would display the results as required for the deployment portion specified by the project guidelines.

⦁time permiting this would likely use django framework for deployment if not postman would likely be used
